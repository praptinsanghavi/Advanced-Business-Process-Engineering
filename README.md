The final module explores modern delivery strategies, introducing Agile, Lean, DevOps, and CI/CD practices to illustrate how high-performing organizations accelerate value delivery. By combining product management, supply chain strategy, and digital delivery methods, this course equips students with the knowledge and skills to drive innovation from concept to customer across diverse industries.
